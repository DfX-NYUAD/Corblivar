 Corblivar is a simulated-annealing-based floorplanning suite for 3D ICs, with special
 emphasis on structural planning of massive interconnects by block alignment

 To compile and run Corblivar, you require things from these (possibly not complete) list:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - clang++
 - gnuplot
 - octave
 - perl
 - cairosvg-py3
 - a modified copy of the BU's HotSpot version (applicable for 3D IC thermal analysis);
 the code is (hopefully) provided along with Corblivar

 The following comments are applicable to exp/, the experiments folder provided with
 Corblivar
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Various experiments can be started using run*.sh; these scripts are not a complete set
 for running all experiments but rather a guideline for different setups

 - benches/ includes MCNC (some are not working, i.e., have issues with their content),
 GSRC, and IBM-HB+ benchmarks, all in the GSRC format

 - thermal_analysis_fitting/ includes Octave scripts for parameterization of
 power-blurring-based thermal analysis; they can be also included e.g. in run*.sh scripts

 - gp.sh delegates to gnuplot for generating various outputs after running Corbilvar

 - HotSpot.sh calls a (slightly modified) version of BU's 3D HotSpot program; the related,
 self-contained HotSpot code is (hopefully) provided along with Corblivar

 - Corblivar.conf is a template for the config file required by Corblivar
