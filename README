 Corblivar is a simulated-annealing-based floorplanning suite for 3D ICs, with special
 emphasis on structural planning of massive interconnects by block alignment.

 If you find this tool useful, and apply it for your research and publications, please
 cite our paper:

 Block Alignment" Proc. Asia South Pacific Des. Autom. Conf., 2014, 53-60

 To compile, run and evaluate Corblivar, you require items from this (possibly not complete) list:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - clang++ (at least version 3.1 required; compiling w/ version 3.2 was tested)
 - gnuplot
 - octave
 - perl
 - cairosvg-py3
 - a modified copy of the BU's HotSpot version (applicable for 3D IC thermal analysis);
 the code is (hopefully) provided along with Corblivar

 The following comments are applicable to exp/, the experiments folder provided with
 Corblivar
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Settings in some scripts may rely on the folder ~/code --- putting ~/code/Corblivar
 along with ~/code/HotSpot is the default setup which should be working in any case

 - Various experiments can be started using run*.sh; these scripts are not a complete set
 for running all experiments but rather a guideline for different setups

 - benches/ includes MCNC (some are not working, i.e., have issues with their content),
 GSRC, and IBM-HB+ benchmarks, all in the GSRC format

 - thermal_analysis_fitting/ includes Octave scripts for parameterization of
 power-blurring-based thermal analysis; they can be also included e.g. in run*.sh scripts;
 currently, these scripts will work on the parent folder, i.e., you might want to copy
 thermal_analysis_fitting as a subfolder for your experiments, see e.g., run9.sh

 - gp.sh delegates to gnuplot for generating various outputs after running Corbilvar

 - HotSpot.sh calls a (slightly modified) version of BU's 3D HotSpot program; the related,
 self-contained HotSpot code is (hopefully) provided along with Corblivar

 - Corblivar.conf is a template for the config file required by Corblivar
