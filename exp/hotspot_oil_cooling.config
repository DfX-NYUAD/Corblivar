# This is an example hotspot configuration file.
# It demonstrates the importance of secondary heat transfer path 
# in a special cooling scenario -- oil flowing over bare # silicon 
# during infrared thermal measurements.
# Convergence is in this oil config slower than typical heatsink configs. 
#
# More details about this configuration can be found in the following papers:
